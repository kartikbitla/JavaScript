More Modern JS Concepts

* SPREAD OPERATOR - Spread Operator is used to unpack iterable (e.g an array) it into individual elements.
 exa:- let myArray = [1, 2, 3];
           ...myArray ---> 1, 2, 3


Spread Operator - Spread Operator syntax can be used to pass and array of Arguments to the function.
exa:- function add(a, b, c){
    return a + b + c;
}

let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(add(...numbers));


Extra values will be ignored if more arguments are passed than function parameters.
exa:-
function add(a, b, c){
    return a + b + c;
}

let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(add(...numbers));


* REST PARAMETER - With rest Parameter, we can pack multiple valus into an array
exa:- function numbers(...args){
    console.log(args);   ---> [1, 2, 3]
}
numbers(1, 2 , 3);


* DESTRUCTURING ARRAYS
let [a, b, c] = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(a);    -> 1
console.log(b);    -> 2     
console.log(c);    -> 3


* DEFAULT PARAMETERS
It allows us to give default values to function parameters
function numbers(a=2, b=5){
    console.log(a);
    console.log(b);
}

numbers();  ## even if we pass any value here in the calling function, that will be assigned to 1st parameter in the function



* TEMPLATE LITERALS(TEMPLATE STRINGS)
 Template Literals are enclosed by the backticks(``)

They are used to
    * Embed variable or expressions in the strings
    * Write multiple strings

These variable or expressions are included using dollar sign with curly braces ${}
exa:-
let firstName = "Kartik";
console.log(`Hello ${firstName}`);


* TERNARY OPERATOR
    A Ternary Operator can be used to replace if...else statements in some situations
    condition? expression1 : expression2;

    exa:-
    let speed = 70;
    let message = speed >= 100? : "Too Fast": "OK";
    console.log(message);  ---> OK

* SWITCH STATEMENT
    A conditional statement like if..else statement used in decision making
    switch(expression){
        case value1:
        //statement(s)
        break;
        
        case value2:
        //statement(s)
        break;

        case value3:
        //statement(s)
        break;

        default:
        //statement(s)
        break;
    }



* DEFINING FUNCTIONS
    There are multiple ways to define a function
        * Function Declaration
        * Function Expression
        * Arrow Functions
        * Function Constructor   ....many more

    Function Declaration
        function add(a, b){
            return a + b;
        }
        console.log(add(4, 3));


    Functin Expression
        let add = function(a, b){
            return a + b;
        }    
        console.log(add(4, 3));

    

    Arrow Functions - An Arrow function is a simple and concise syntax for defining functions
    It is an alternative to a function expression
    let add = (a, b) => {
        return a+b;
    }
    add(4, 3);

    //Simple version of arrow function
    let add = (a, b) => a+b;
    let a = add(4,3);
    console.log(a);


    If there is only one parameter, then parentheses are not required.
    let functionName = parameter => expression;


    If there are no parameters, parenthese will be empty (but they should be present)
    let sayHi = () => "Hello!";
    console.log(sayHi());



* CREATING MULTIPLE OBJECTS
    * Using object literals
    * Using factory function
    * Using constructor function
    * Using JS Classes

    Using Object Literals
    let car1 = {
        color: "blue",
        brand: "Audi",
        start: function(){
            console.log("Started");
        }
    };


    Factory Function - A Factory function is any function that returns a new object for every function call
                       Function name should follow camelCase naming Convention

    function createCar(color, brand){
        return {
            color,
            brand,
            start(){
                console.log("Started");
            }
        }
    }

    let car1 = createCar("Blue", "Tata");
    let car2 = createCar("Red", "BMW");



    Constructor Function - A regular function that returns a new object on calling with the new operator
                           The created new object is called an instance
                           Function name should follow PascallCase naming Convention


                           When a function is called with new, it does the following steps:
                            * Creates and empty object and assigns to this
                            * Return this


                            function car(color, brand){
                                this.color = color;
                                this.brand  = brand;
                                this.start = function(){
                                    console.log("Started");
                                }
                            }

                            let car1 = new car("Blue", "BMW");  //here car1 will be referred as instance
                            console.log(car1)

                            car1 is instance
                            car1.start() is instance method
                            car1.color, car1.brand are instance properties


    Factory vs Constructor Functions
    Factory Functions               Constructor Functions
    * Follows camelCase notation    * Follow PascalCase notation
    * No need of new Operator for   * Need new Operator for function calling
      function calling
    * Explicitly need to return     * Ceated object returns implicitly 
      the Object



    Functions are Objects - Similar to Objects, function also have properties and methods.
    
    Default function properties and Methods
    Properties              Methods
     - name                 - apply()
     - length               - bind()
     - constructor          - call()
     - prototype            - toString()



    function car(color, brand){
            this.color = color;
            this.brand  = brand;
            this.start = function(){
                console.log("Started");
            }
        }

    car.name --> car //will return the name of the function
    car.length --> //will return the number of parameters we have passed to the function


    Constructor Property
    Every object in javaScript has a constructor property, The constructor property refers to the constructor function which is used to create the object.
    car1.constructor // car(color, brand) -> it will return the constructor function



    Built-in Constructor functions
    These are the Constructor functions provided by the javaScript already
    
    * function Date() //To work with date and time in our applications, we use built-in Date Constructor function
    let now = new Date(); //creating a Date object without passing any arguments to the function gives current date and time
    let now = new Date("2023-11-29"); //If you would like desire date string then we can pass an argument to the date function like this
    new Date(year, month, date, hours, minutes, seconds, ms);

    
    
    * function Error()
    * function Promise()
    * function Object()
    * function String()
    * function Number()



* THIS
    this is determindd in three ways
        In object methods, this refers to the
        - Object that is executing th current function
        
        
        In regular function, this refers to the 
        - Global object

        In Arrow functions, this refers to the
        - Context in which the code is defined


        1. Object methods
        let car = {
            color:"blue",
            brand:"Audi", 
            start:function(){
                console.log(this);
            }
        }
        car.start();

        //{ color: 'blue', brand: 'Audi', start: [Function: start] }
        this refers to the object that is executing the current function


        2. Regular function
        function start(){
            console.log(this);
        }
        start();
        In Regular function, this refers to the window Object (window object will be explained further)


        3. Arrow function
        In Arrow functions, this depends on two aspects:
        * When the code is defined
        * Context


                When the code is Defined
                When is callback function defined?

                let car = {
                    color:"blue",
                    brand:"Audi",
                    start:function(){
                        setTimeout(function(){
                            console.log(this);
                        }, 1000);
                    }
                };

                car.start();



                Context
                exa 1
                console.log(this);  //this = window

                exa 2
                let car = {
                    color:"blue",
                    brand:"Audi",
                    start:function(){
                        console.log(this);
                    }
                };

                car.start();    // this = car



                This is Arrow function
                Object Method

                let car = {
                    color:"blue",
                    brand:"Audi",
                    start:() => {
                        console.log(this);
                    }
                };

                car.start();   //result will be window object
                Arrow function inherits this from the context in which the code is defined


                this in callbacks
                Arrow functions with callbacks

                let car = {
                    color:"blue",
                    brand:"audi",
                    start:function(){
                        setTimeout(() => {
                            console.log(this);
                        },1000);
                    }
                };
                car.start();   //this = car


                another example
                Arrow functions with callbacks
                let cars = ["audi", "bmw", "mercedes"];
                let car = {
                    color:"blue",
                    brand:"audi",
                    start:function(){
                        let audiIndex = cars.findIndex(
                            (car) => console.log(this);
                        );
                    }
                };
                car.start();  / this = car


this
Constructor Functions
When a function is called with new, it does the following steps:
    - Creates an empty object and assigns to this
    - Return this


    function Car(color, brand){
        this.color = color;
        this.brand = brand;
        this.start = function(){
            console.log(this);
        };
    }

    let car1 = new Car("blue", "Audi");
    car1.start();
    In Constructor function, this refers to the instance object  // this = car1



this Arrow function as method

function Car(color, brand){
    this.color = color;
    this.brand = brand;
    this.start = () => {
        console.log(this);
    };
}

let car1 = new Car("blue", "Audi");
console.log(car1);   // this = car1
Arrow function inherits this from the context in which the code is defined



Values
Primitives & Objects

All the primitive type values are immutable
All the objects are mutuable

Primitive Types             Objects
Number                      Object
String                      Array
Boolean                     Function
Symbol
Undefined



All the primitive type values are immutable
let x = 5;
let y = x;
y = 10;
cosole.log(x);   //5  //here new object has been created, not referring to same object
console.log(y);  //10


All the objects are mutuable
let x = {value:5};
let y = x;
let z = {value:20};
y.value = 10;
console.log(x);  //Object {value:10}  //because they are referring to same object
console.log(y);  //Object {value:10}
y = z;
console.log(x);  //Object {value:10}
console.log(y);  //Object {value:20}


HOW A JS CODE WORKS
web API>Callstack>global execution>callstack queue>final code execute


String Manipulations
trim() -> The trim() method removes whitespaces from both ends of a string.
slice() -> The slice() method extracts a section of a string and returns it as a new string, Without modifying the original string.
toUpperCase() -> The toUpperCase() method returns the value converted to uppercase.
trim() -> The trim( ) method removes whitespace from both ends of a string.
indexOf() -> The indexOf() method returns the position of the first occurrence of a specified value in a string.
concat -> The concat() method is used to join two or more strings.
startsWith -> The startsWith() method determines whether a string begins with the characters of a specified string, returning true or false as appropriate.
includes() -> The includes() method determines whether a string contains the characters of a specified string.
endsWith -> The endsWith() method determines whether a string ends with the characters of a specified string, returning true or false as appropriate.
split() -> The split() method is used to split a string into an array of substrings and returns the new array.
toString -> The toString() method returns the value of a string object.
toLowerCase -> The toUpperCase() method returns the value converted to lowercase.
replace() -> The replace() method searches a string for a specified value, or a regular expression, and returns a new string where the specified value is replaced.
subString -> The substring() method returns the part of the string between the start and end indexes, or to the end of the string.
length -> The length property returns the length of a string (number of characters).


Scoping
Scope is the region of the code where a certain variable can be accessed.
1. Block Scope
2. Global Scope

Block Scope - If a variable is declared using const or let within a curly brace ({}), then it is said to be defined in the Block Scope.
Global Scope - If a variable is declared outside all functions and curly braces ({}), then it is said to be defined in the Global Scope.

When we access a variable defined using let or const, Javascript searches for the Variable in the block scope first followed by global scope.



HOISTING:-
Hoisting is a javascript mechanism where function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.
only the function delaration are hoisted, Function expressions and arrow functions in javascript are not hoisted.


Map, Filter & Reduce functions
map(), filter(), reduce() are array methods in JavaScript. Each method iterates over an array and performs an operation.


Array Methods:-
Mutable & Immutable
Mutable methods will change the original array
* shift()
* unshift()
* push()
* splice()


Immutable methods wont change the original array
* map()
* filter()
* reduce()
* slice()

THIS
this is determined in three ways
In object methods, this refers to the
 - Object that is executing the current function

In Regular function, this refers to the
 - Global function

In Arrow function, this refers to the
 - Context in which the code is defined
